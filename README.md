<h1>EduVerse â€“ Full Stack Digital Learning Platform</h1>
EduVerse is a full-stack digital learning platform built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It enables instructors to upload structured video lectures and students to watch, interact, and learn in a distraction-free environment.

Unlike general-purpose platforms, EduVerse is designed exclusively for education â€” with a mission to make quality learning affordable, ad-free, and community-driven.
